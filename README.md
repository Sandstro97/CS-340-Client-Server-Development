# CS340

- How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I think that one of the main things to consider when it comes to writing code is to make it as simple as possible, and to make sure you always make sure your code is readable because if your code is not, then it is hard for you or someone else to work on the project. You also need to constantly be testing your code to make sure you are on the right track otherwise you will have to redue all your work.

- How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

If you come to a problem always make sure to ask questions where you might not fully understand what is happening. If I was struggling with anything I made sure to first look up ways to help me with the code and then test to see if I had figured it out myself, and if that did not work I would ask for help from someone who is more experienced than I am. One thing that I did differently this course than others was I used a lot of mongodb.com as a reference for many of my issues that I experienced during this term.

- What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientists have a variety of jobs to do but their main job is to solve problems. Anything that deals with technology there was a problem somewhere that needed to be fixed and that is how the job of being a computer scientist came to be. I think this project was one example of the different problems that you may experience as a Computer Scientist.
